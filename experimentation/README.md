# Artifice Experiments

## Entropy-test

This is a basic kernel module for testing reading data from a file system from the kernel.

The header and .c files contain code used to retrieve entropy data from the public file system if a Reed-Solomon+Entropy IDA is desired.

The technique is considered dangerous and ill advised by the kernel development community in general.

## Reed-Solomon

A variety of Reed-Solomon erasure coding implementations.
