    The focus of this test is the proportion of zeros and ones for the entire sequence. The purpose of this test is
    to determine whether the number of ones and zeros in a sequence are approximately the same as would be expected
    for a truly random sequence. This test assesses the closeness of the fraction of ones to 1/2, that is the number
    of ones and zeros ina  sequence should be about the same. All subsequent tests depend on this test.
